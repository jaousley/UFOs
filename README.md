# UFOs

## Purpose 
The purpose of the analysis is to create a webpage where visitors can filter through data regarding her findings about UFO sightings. By using JavaScript, the data is displayed as a table. Due to the large amount of data, filters were added to fine tune the results. 

## Results 
When the webpage first loads, visitors will see the article title, Danaâ€™s findings, and all of the UFO sighting data below.

Visitors can choose to filter by a specific date to minimize the data shown.

Visitors can also filter by city and after pressing enter all the sightings in that city will be shown

## Summary

One drawback of this new design is the user still has to scroll through all of the data to even know what the options are for each category. It would be easier for users if there was a drop down arrow for each category showing all of the options. Another recommendation would be to have the sightings listed with the most recent at the top when the webpage first loads. Most likely people will be looking for information on something they recently saw so having the most recent sightings shown first would be more useful.
